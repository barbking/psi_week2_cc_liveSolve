# Node Express jQuery Code Challenge

## The Joke Book

Your client has asked you to create a Joke Book application. The server will contain all the current joke data and you have been provided with the initial server file `server.js`.

## Your Task
* all jokes should be displayed on the DOM below the inputs
* the user should be able to add jokes using the input form

### How the joke data is structured
You can view the full object in ```server.js```. The data structure is an array of objects. These objects have three properties: whoseJoke, jokeQuestion, and punchLine.

```
jokes = [
  {
    whoseJoke: "Huck",
    jokeQuestion: "What's the difference between roast beef and pea soup?",
    punchLine: "Anyone can roast beef."
  }]
```

## To Start
To get started, fork this repo and clone your copy to your computer.

Remember to work in small increments and test often. Once you complete the above tasks, commit your work and submit the github url for your repository to the Prime Assignment application.
